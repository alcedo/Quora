This is a sample resume template that is inspired by Quora's overall theme. (some-what)


view it here! http://rawgithub.com/alcedo/Quora/master/resume_template/resume.html (without https)


The idea is to have github to host this resume template, hence all library files are hosted on CDN. Images are hotlinked from other sources and *may* break if link is no longer valid 

Works nicely on mobile devices.

Done in bootstrap3 RC1
